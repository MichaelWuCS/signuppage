# signuppage
 This is a side project I worked on during my summer 2020 internship with Blizzard Entertainment as a part of their Corporate Applications team. This is a semi-complete sign-up page where I learnt the basics of the Vue CLI framework and associated materials such as Axios responses and basic unit tests. This was developed over the period of a week.
